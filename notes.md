I have to make 2 components, the 
    - City Function
    - ZipSearch Function

Okay, so we are supposed to get the data from the api end point when you type in the information, so like
https://ctp-zip-code-api.onrender.com/zip/11421 -- should give us all the information that we need to build the city function.

But for now, my problem is how am I supposed to get that data from the api endpoint in the zipsearch function.
